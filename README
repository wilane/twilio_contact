WHAT'S THIS
===========

This is to demonstrate the usage of the Twilio API. This application allows
someone from the web to contact you without knowing your phone number.

 * A user surf your site, fill a form with providing name, phone number and
   motives of the call.
 * The application will use Twilio API to call the user (US number only) and
   reminds the user that he wants to call you and the motives at which point you
   can press 1 to proceed or 2 to cancel the call
 * If the user wants to proceed, the application will call you letting you know
   that the user wants to talk to you.
 * If you press 1 to accept the call then you're connected to the user.
 * If you press 2 the user is asked to leave you a message and the message is
   transcribed and sent to you and to the user with an url that points to the
   audio of the voicemail.
