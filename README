This is a Django project with an app called contact. It's easy to
deploy like any Django project.

The application use some config params that you can put in settings.py
or in a file local_settings.py:

API_VERSION = '2008-08-01'
ACCOUNT_SID = ''
ACCOUNT_TOKEN = ''

CALLER_ID = ''

MY_EMAIL = ''
MY_NUMBER = ''
BASE_URL = ''

If you don't define them the app zill crash on you, not much checking
is done, it's more a quick'n'dirty poc of the power of Twilio.
